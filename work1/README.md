A realistic photo of a small fluffy dog going to a Korean kindergarten while keeping its natural four-legged dog form. The dog should wear a bright yellow Korean kindergarten hat and a matching small yellow backpack with a cute design. A small lunchbox should be placed next to the dog or attached to the backpack. Change the background to a Korean kindergarten entrance with colorful decorations, play structures, and a cheerful atmosphere. Make sure no text, letters, or signage appear anywhere in the image. Keep the dog’s face, fur, and proportions natural, only changing clothing, accessories, and background. Use natural morning light, soft shadows, and a realistic photography style.

Create a short realistic video of the same small fluffy dog, still in its natural four-legged form, dressed in Korean kindergarten style. The dog is wearing a yellow kindergarten hat and a small yellow backpack, walking happily towards the entrance of a Korean kindergarten. The background should clearly show a kindergarten setting with colorful decorations, playground equipment, and children in yellow hats, but with no text, letters, or signage visible. The dog should wag its tail, take cheerful small steps, and look excited as if it is going to school. Use natural morning sunlight, cinematic lighting, and smooth camera movements to create a realistic, cheerful scene.
